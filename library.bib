@article{Hintzman1975,
  abstract = {Three experiments examined effects of the spacing of repetitions on memory for pictures. In Experiment I, the duration of the first presentation (P(1)) was manipulated, as was P(1)-P(2) spacing. The effect of spacing on judged frequency was independent of P(1) duration. In Experiment II, pictures were given M massed presentations just prior to the P(M)-P(M+1) spacing interval. The form of the spacing curve was independent of M. Neither experiment confirmed the prediction of "overhabituation," derived from the habituation-recovery explanation of the spacing effect. In Experiment III, subjects made both duration and frequency judgments. The duration judgment results were not consistent with the notion that subjects remember multiple massed presentations as single occurrences of especially long duration. Some evidence from Experiments I and III suggests that an interrupted stimulus is recognized better than one that is not interrupted-a finding that, if replicable, would support the habituation-recovery account of the spacing effect.},

@article{Hintzman1970a,
  abstract = {Presented 4 experiments using the same basic design: 117, 116, 108, and 103 undergraduates were presented visually with a series of words which varied both in frequency of repetition (F) and in exposure duration (D). 4 levels of F (1, 2, 3, and 5 repetitions) were combined orthogonally with 5 levels of D (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 sec.) so that a repeated word always occurred for the same duration. Dependent variables were: judgment of frequency (JOF), judgment of duration (JOD), recognition performance, and free recall. JOF, recognition, and free recall were highly correlated with F, but relatively unaffected by D. JOD, in contrast, was affected by both F and D, showing that D does have an effect on memory. It is suggested that JOF is based on the strength of the long-term memory trace, while JOD is based partly on strength and partly on an independent dimension of the trace related to D. The total-time hypothesis does not appear to hold when D is manipulated within lists.},
