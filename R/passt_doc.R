#' passt: Simulates judgments of frequency and duration with a
#' competitive learning network based on the PASS-family
#'
#' To run a simulation you will just need to use the function
#' \code{\link{run_sim}}, which will take care of the rest. To run
#' several simulations and get a standard analysis use the function
#' \code{\link{run_exp}}. Both functions take care of the details,
#' while you are still able to set the most important parameters such
#' as the learning rate development, the input patterns and the
#' independent variables of exposure frequency and exposure duration.
